# Irrigation_System




This project uses real-time data to automate and monitor an irrigation system.
The system reads soil moisture from a CSV file and processes it using Python.
Based on the analysis, it recommends whether to water crops or not.
Run the Jupyter Notebook Irrigation_System.ipynb to simulate the automation logic.
